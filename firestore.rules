/**
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset establishes a clear security boundary between publicly accessible data
 * and private user-specific information. The primary goal is to allow anonymous users
 * to browse restaurant details, menus, and events, while strictly protecting user
 * profiles and actions like making reservations or writing reviews.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The data is organized into two main top-level collections:
 * 1. `/restaurants/{restaurantId}`: This public-facing collection holds all data
 *    related to a specific restaurant, including nested subcollections for menu items,
 *    events, reviews, and reservations.
 * 2. `/userProfiles/{userId}`: This collection stores private user data, where each
 *    document is keyed by the user's authentication UID and is only accessible by that user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public Read, Admin Write: Core restaurant data (details, menus, events) is publicly
 *   readable by anyone, but all write operations (create, update, delete) are disallowed
 *   at the client level. This assumes a trusted backend service or admin panel is
 *   responsible for managing this content, providing a highly secure default.
 * - Strict User Ownership: User profiles are strictly private. A user can only create,
 *   read, update, or delete their own profile document. Listing user profiles is disabled.
 * - Private Reservations: While reservations are nested under a public restaurant, access
 *   to individual reservation documents is restricted to the user who created them. Listing
 *   all reservations for a restaurant is disallowed to protect user privacy.
 * - Public Reviews with Ownership: Customer reviews are publicly readable by everyone,
 *   but creating, updating, or deleting a review is restricted to the authenticated
 *   user who authored it.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * To ensure fast and secure rules, authorization data is denormalized. Documents like
 * `TableReservation` and `CustomerReview` contain a `userId` field. This allows rules
 * to verify ownership directly from the document being accessed, avoiding slow and costly
 * cross-document `get()` calls.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * User data (`userProfiles`) is stored in a completely separate collection from public
 * restaurant data, ensuring that distinct and simple access control policies can be applied
 * to each data type without overlap or complexity.
